# titanic_dataset
This project is my first complete end-to-end machine learning project, building a deep learning model to predict passenger survival on the RMS Titanic.  The goal was to clean the data, engineer relevant features, and then build, train, and evaluate a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.
